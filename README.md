# GALMUN-2023
The site that was used for GALMUN in 2023.\
GalMUN is a model united nations, whereby participants are assigned countries that they represent so that they nay debate on different topics.\
The website has since been updated/changed to a newer, different version.\
Me and a colleague of mine were in charge of updating the website with the new members and new themes for the respective year.
